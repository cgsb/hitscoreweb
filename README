CGSB Genomics Core Facility Website


The project is still in embryo state, but with the following commands:

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    make

and optional:
    make install

From current directory, with:
    hitscoreweb.native test
one should get something at http://localhost:8080.

Also:
    make static
(installs and) builds hitscoreserver. It can be launched with:
    hitscoreweb static

Finally:
    hitscore rpm
launches the (experimental) generation of the RPM package.


*** OASIS Generated Files ***

These files:
    myocamlbuild.ml
    setup.ml
    _tags
    src/lib/META
    src/lib/hitscoreweb.mllib
are completely auto-generated by:
    oasis setup
but it is safer/easier not to depend on OASIS all the time.
