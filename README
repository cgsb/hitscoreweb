CGSB Core Facility Website

The project is still in embryo state, but with the following commands:

    ocaml setup.ml -configure
    ocaml setup.ml -build
    ocaml setup.ml -install
  
    sh src/app/hitscore_web_ocsigen
    
one should get something at http://localhost:8080.


*** OASIS Generated Files ***

These files:
    myocamlbuild.ml
    setup.ml
    _tags
    src/lib/META
    src/lib/Hitscore_web.mllib
are completely auto-generated by:
    oasis setup
but it is safer/easier not to depend on OASIS all the time.


*** Findlib lib ***

The current findlib name is “hitscoreweb”, but this may change in the
future.
